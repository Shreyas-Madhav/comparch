## Welcome to ECS 154B!

This site is currently **UNDER CONSTRUCTION**.
All information is subject to change!
The content is *currently* being updated from Spring 2020.

![Under construction](/img/under-construction.png)

You will find all of the lecture videos, quizzes, and extra information here.

For more information on the class, see [the syllabus]({{'syllabus' | relative_url}}).

The class is broken into four main components: [Introduction to Computer Architecture](intro/index.md), [Processor Architecture](processor/index.md), [Memory Architecture](memory/index.md), and [Parallel Architecture](parallel/index.md).

All lecture videos will be available on this website.
You are responsible for the information in both the videos and found in these pages.
All notes can be found in the [One Note notebook](https://ucdavis365-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/jlowepower_ucdavis_edu/EpvsyzTRfnpJoN8rUDnWDSIBTdZenG15a-gExSwGLLJliw?e=rcteh2).

The information here is subject to change, especially the parts later in the quarter.

## Detailed Class Outline

The class will generally be broken up into three parts, with more emphasis on the first section than the other two.
Each section will begin with the motivation for why you should care about this architectural component based on the performance or other metrics of the system.
Then, after going through the design details, we will summarize with specific example from modern systems.

Each section will have one or two project-based assignments (e.g., with the [DINO CPU](https://github.com/jlpteaching/dinocpu-wq21)) and end with an exam.

### [Introduction to Computer Architecture](intro/index.md) (About one week)

In the first section of the class we will cover some motivation for why you should care about computer architecture and general computer architecture principles.

This first section is going to be part of the "soft launch" or "transition period" for moving to online learning.
There are due dates listed for the quizzes.
However, for this first section *there will be no late penalty*.

* [Introduction to the class](intro/intro.md) (Quiz due 3/31)
* [Security and computer architecture](intro/security.md) (Quiz due 3/31)
* [Current Computing Technology](intro/technology.md) (Quizzes due 4/2)
* [Computer System Evaluation](intro/evaluation.md) (Quizzes due 4/7)

### [Processor Architecture](processor/index.md) (About four weeks)

* [Instruction set architectures and RISC-V](processor/isa.md) (Quizzes due 4/9) ([Assignment 1](https://github.com/jlpteaching/dinocpu-sq20/blob/master/assignments/assignment-1.md) Due 4/13)
* [Single cycle CPU design](processor/single-cycle.md) (Quizzes due 4/14 & 4/16) ([Assignment 2](https://github.com/jlpteaching/dinocpu-sq20/blob/master/assignments/assignment-2.md) Due 4/20)
* [Pipelined CPU design](processor/pipelined.md) (Quizzes due 4/21 & 4/23) ([Assignment 3.1](https://github.com/jlpteaching/dinocpu-sq20/blob/master/assignments/assignment-3.md) Due 4/27)
* [Instruction-level parallelism](processor/ilp.md) (Quizzes due 4/28 & 4/30)
* [Processor architecture summary](processor/summary.md)

**Test on 5/5**

### [Memory System Architecture](memory/index.md) (About three weeks)

* [Memory technology](memory/technology.md) (Quiz due 5/12) ([Assignment 3.2](https://github.com/jlpteaching/dinocpu-sq20/blob/master/assignments/assignment-3.md) Due 5/11)
* [Caches and memory hierarchy](memory/caches.md) (Quizzes due 5/14 & 5/19 & 5/21)
* [Virtual memory](memory/virtual.md) (Quizzes due 5/26 & 5/28)
* [Memory architecture summary](memory/summary.md) ([Assignment 4](https://github.com/jlpteaching/dinocpu-sq20/blob/master/assignments/assignment-4.md) Due 5/25)

**Test on 6/8**

### [Parallel Architectures](parallel/index.md) (About two weeks)

* [Parallel systems' performance](parallel/performance.md) (Quizzes due on 6/4)
* [Parallel architectures and programming](parallel/architectures.md) (Quizzes due on 6/4) ([Assignment 5](https://github.com/jlpteaching/dinocpu-sq20/blob/master/assignments/assignment-5.md) Due 6/8)
