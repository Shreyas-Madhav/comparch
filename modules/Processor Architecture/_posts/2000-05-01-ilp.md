## Static ILP

{% include reading.html section="Section 4.10" %}

### Instruction scheduling

There is a limit to the rate we can execute instructions in a pipelined design.
Specifically, things like loads and branches cause *hazards* which push our CPI above 1 by forcing us to insert bubbles and stall the processor.
In the video below, we explore how we can reduce the number of hazards by slightly changing our program (or, in other words, leveraging the compiler).

This is a video on how to get parallelism by statically finding independent instructions and how to improve performance with static instruction scheduling.

### A new ISA type: VLIW

So, now that we have seen how we can use the compiler to statically "rewrite" our code to hide/overcome hazards and stalls in our pipeline, let's think of how we can take this to the next step.
Part of what we did above was find instructions that were *independent* which means that there is no reason not to execute them *at the same time*.
Using this insight, we can develop a new kind of ISA in which we can explicitly tell the hardware what instructions are independent so that the hardware can execute them *in parallel*.

{% include video.html id="0_cuql5qo6" %}

{% include prompt.html content="
How would you modify the pipelined CPU design [discussed previously](../pipelined) to implement a VLIW instruction set?
" %}

Obviously, there are pros and cons to VLIW-like ISAs.
In fact, as you can probably guess, there are more cons than pros (we haven't talked about VLIW until now, right?).
The next video discusses some of why we don't see VLIW systems today.

{% include video.html id="0_wk3y9639" %}

{% include prompt.html content="
So, it's difficult to always find independent instructions statically.
But what about *dynamically*?

Can you think of a way to modify the pipelined design to issue two instructions (or more!) every cycle?

#### A bit about Intel Itanium (a *real* VLIW design)

Rather than listen to me talk about the history of the Itanium, let's go back to the Turing Lecture and have Dave Patterson explain why it failed!

### **QUIZ** Static scheduling

## Dynamic ILP

{% include reading.html section="Section 4.10" %}

Now, can we do the same thing as we discussed above, but do it automatically in hardware?

### Dynamic instruction scheduling

#### A cool historical perspective

{% include reading.html optional="true" book="[*Dynamic Instruction Scheduling* Conway et al.](https://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/ACS/DIS/DIS.pdf)" section="https://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/ACS/DIS/DIS.pdf" %}

DIS is one possible implementation of dynamic ILP.
It's one of the first descriptions of a hardware mechanism for ILP.
Interestingly, this idea was lost for decades.
Computer historians overwrote this history, and if you read your book or most other references it will say that the first algorithm for dynamically issuing instructions is Tomasulo's algorithm.

Norm Hardy said of DIS: "It was superscalar, and the instructions were rather simple -- it was the first design that I had heard of with the idea of issuing more than one instruction per clock cycle -- I can recall thinking that that was barely credible at the beginning. It turns out, in retrospect, to be the right way to build a machine. But I can remember being quite in awe of the very idea--in fact, I thought that executing one instruction per clock cycle was quite remarkable"

I strongly encourage you to read about [Lynn Conway's story](https://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/Retrospective2.html#anchor100470).
Her [website](https://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/) is a treasure trove of fascinating computer architecture history.
Not only did she likely invent the first method for out of order execution, but she essentially [started the VLSI revolution](https://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/Retrospective3.html#anchor42852) that was a major driver of Moore's Law!

She has some great talks that she's given as well.
If you have time, *please* check these out.
It's a great way to see some insight into the human aspects of computer science history.
[This video](https://youtu.be/7ncuhRYmfJw) is long, but similar to the talk she gave at Davis a couple of years ago.
At around the 20 minute mark is where she starts talking about computer architecture.

#### DIS details

{% include video.html id="0_4z25jj2k" %}

This is a video introduces how to get parallelism by dynamically finding independent instructions.

{% include video.html id="0_f6gvn5wi" %}

This video describes an algorithm called DIS which can be implemented in hardware to decide which instructions are allowed to execute at any time.

## Register renaming

Finally, this video discusses how to overcome WAW and WAR hazards by using register renaming.
