# Parallel Architectures

![Picture of NVIDIA Ampere architecture]({{"/img/ampere.png" | relative_url}})

In the [processor section](../processor/index.md) we learned about *instruction-*level parallelism and how there are limits to how much parallelism there is in our applications.
However, we can overcome this, by leveraging *multiple processors*.

In this section, we're going to learn about how to combine multiple *independent* instruction streams executing on different hardware to improve performance.
